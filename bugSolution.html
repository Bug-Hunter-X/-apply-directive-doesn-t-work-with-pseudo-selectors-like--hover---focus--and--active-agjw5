The solution is to avoid using the `@apply` directive with pseudo-selectors. Instead, apply the styles directly to the element in your HTML:

```html
<button class="hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

This ensures the `bg-blue-500` class is correctly applied when the button is hovered.  The same principle applies to other pseudo-selectors like `:focus` and `:active`.
