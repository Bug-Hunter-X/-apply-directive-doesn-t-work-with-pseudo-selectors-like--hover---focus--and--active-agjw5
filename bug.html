This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a utility class that uses a pseudo-selector like `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active`. The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly handle these pseudo-selectors, and the styles aren't applied to the element in the expected state.

For example:

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

In this case, the `bg-blue-500` class will not be applied when the button is hovered.

This also applies to other pseudo-classes like `:focus` and `:active`.
